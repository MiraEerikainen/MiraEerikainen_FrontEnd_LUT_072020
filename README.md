This is my coursework for LUT Front-End Module, Summer 2020.


The course included creating a responsive portfolio website following tutorial by Brad Traversy @ Traversy Media, and keeping a Learning Diary.


You can see and browse the final website here:

The website was created using html5, Sass/SCC (e.g. CSS transitions, Sass Mixins, CSS Grids, CSS Flexboxes and lots of other stuff) and some Javascript for the menu button.


To see how the website and responsiveness work in action, check this video out:
